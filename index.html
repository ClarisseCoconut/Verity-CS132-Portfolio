			<div class="container">
				<header>
					<h1>Data Exploration</h1>
					<p>At this point, we have the data to analyze. But before we jump to modeling, we need to make sure our data is clean.</p>
				</header>
				<div class="green-box pan-scroll-left">
					<h3><white><span class="icon"><i class="loading-icon fas fa-spinner fa-spin"></i> Preprocessing</white></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
						<article class="box style5" onclick="toggleBoxContent(this)">
							<h3>General<br>Preprocessing</h3>
							<div class="box-content">
								<br>
								<p><g>Before getting started we first import necessary modules for processing the data. These include <b>pandas</b>, <b>matplotlib.pyplot</b> and <b>seaborn</b>.</g></p>
								<h4><green>Handling missing values</green></h4>
								<p><g>The data columns that contained null values were <b>Add columns, Reviewer, Review, Account Bio, Tweet translated, Views, Remarks, Location,</b> and <b>Reasoning.</b>
								Since these columns had many null values, our team decided to <b>drop</b> them completely.
								<br><br>The same was done for columns we had no use for, like the <b>Account bio, Tweet translated, Views, Remarks, Location, Reasoning,</b> and <b>Screenshot</b>.<br><br>
								For columns with few null values and that may prove to be useful in our research question, we chose to <b>impute</b> values. For example, in the <b>Quote tweets</b> 
								and <b>Replies</b> data column, null values actually meant there were 0 quote tweets/replies for a certain post. Thus, we decided to impute the value <b>0</b> in the null 
								cells of these columns.<br>Note as well that a similar step was done for the <b>Rating</b> column wherein the imputed value is the categorical data <b>"False"</b>.
								</g></p>
								<h4><green>Ensuring formatting consistency</green></h4>
								<p><g>Having an inconsistent format may cause the exploration of the data to have an error or display wrong results.
									Hence, we needed to ensure that the data types were consistent in each column of data. <br><br>Such is the case with the 
									<b>Date Posted</b> and <b>Timestamp</b> columns. Since their values should be timestamps and not strings, we converted their values into the 
									<b>datetime</b> datatype. We also used the .replace method to modify entries in the <b>Rating</b> and <b>Followers</b> columns which had inconsistent formats 
									For example, both numbers with ("2,384") and without ("2384") commas would appear in the dataset.<br><br>
									Note that these errors in the formatting were found as the team were exploring the data.
								</g></p>
								<h4><green>Categorical Encoding</green></h4>
								<p><g>In this section, we convert categorical values into integer formats so that when we feed the data to our machine learning model, 
									we're able to receive better results and predictions. <br><br>There are two commonly used categorical encoding methods: <b>one hot encoding</b> and <b>integer encoding</b>. 
									Our team used <b>one hot encoding</b> for <b>Rating</b> and <b>Content type</b> since the values of these data columns don't have an inherent ordering.
									<br><br>Note that the Content type column had at most 1 content type, while in the Rating column there were some data that had 2 or more ratings.
								</g></p>
							</div>
						</article>
					</div>
					<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
						<article class="box style5" onclick="toggleBoxContent(this)">
							<h3>Natural Language Processing</h3>
							<div class="box-content">
								<br>
								<p><g>After the necessary preprocessing, we move on to natural language processing. Here, we standardize all the tweets in the dataset. 
									For example, we want 'Risa' and 'risa' to be the same value as they mean the same but have different formats. We also want to transform any unnecessary data 
									such as emoticons and emojis by converting them into words. By doing this, we ensure that every piece of data can be processed for our modeling.<br><br>
									To start, we import the necessary modules: <b>re, copy, string,</b> and <b>nltk</b>.
								</g></p>
								<h4><green>Removal of Emojis & Emoticons</green></h4>
								<p><g>
									We would have done this for both the 'Account bio' column and the 'Tweets; column. But since we dropped the account bio column, 
									we will only be performing NLP on the <b>Tweets</b>. In addition, this is not exactly part of our research question, 
									but this data may be useful in the data modeling section of the project so we still chose to process this data. <br><br>
									To turn emojis to words, we pulled a database for emojis from the internet so that we know what text to return for each emoji. 
									We then use this database to change the emojis into workable texts/strings. (ex)

				<div class="container">
					<header>
						<h1>Here's what we found out.</h1>
					</header>
					<div class="container medium">
						<br>
						<p style =  "font-family: inherit; font-size: 25px; text-align: justify;">1. The tweet counts in the pre-election period has a positive linear relationship with the dates while the tweet counts and dates in the election period do not.</p>
						<p style =  "font-family: inherit; font-size: 25px; text-align: justify;">2. Peaks were mainly caused by prominent fake tweets circulating such as the case in the year 2018 (COA fake tweet) and 2021 (Alleged confirmed thievery of Risa). Furthermore, Philhealth issue is always brought up whenever Risa says about something even if its another issue.</p>
						<p style =  "font-family: inherit; font-size: 25px; text-align: justify;">3. Change points and peaks are aligned with the time the prominent fake tweets are circulating as well as the start of the pandemic.</p>
						<p style =  "font-family: inherit; font-size: 25px; text-align: justify;">4. The mis/disinformation with the Philhealth issue is not only with the person attributed to it (Risa Hontiveros) but also the amount being stolen/lost.</p>
						<p style =  "font-family: inherit; font-size: 25px; text-align: justify;">Although there is a positive linear relationship between the tweet frequency and dates in the pre-election period. There is still no significant difference between the pre-election and election period when it comes to the tweet frequency of mis/disinformation tweets attributed to Risa Hontiveros. This has been proven by the Mann-Whitney U test.</p>
						<p style =  "font-family: inherit; font-size: 25px; text-align: justify;">These findings are important since this showcases the severity of what a mis/disinformation can do. It shows how confusion about the whole issue is rampant.</p>
					</div>
					<header>
						<h1>What do these findings imply?</h1>
					</header>
					<div class="container medium">
						<br>
						<p style =  "font-family: inherit; font-size: 25px; text-align: justify;">The potential usage of the research is clearing out the whole issue since the fact-checking articles haven't explicitly stated the whole truth about the issue. This is because the whole Risa Hontiveros PhilHealth controversy is made up of several issues such as the: illegal bonuses, campaign funds, 15 Billion corruption.</p>
					</div>
					<header>
						<h1>Conclusion</h1>
					</header>
					<div class="container medium">
						<br>
						<p style =  "font-family: inherit; font-size: 25px; text-align: justify;">In conclusion, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of our study. There is no significant difference between the pre-election and election period which means that we cannot say that one period had greater tweet frequency over the other. Furthermore, we should make use of this research to study the whole truth about this issue by examining dates even before 2016 and by adding more data. Lastly, we should strongly make a clear and concise statement about the whole truth because the misinformation about this topic is still being spread even today.</p>
